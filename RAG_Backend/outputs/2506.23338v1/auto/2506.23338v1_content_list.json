We discuss the detector responsivity and added noise pointing to its crucial role in the context of force sensitivity. Through analysis of noise measurements we determine the effective temperature of the cantilever eigenmode and we determine the region of detector operation in which the sensor is thermal-noise limited. Our analysis shows that the force-sensor design is a significant improvement over piezoelectric force sensors commonly used in low-temperature AFM. We discuss the potential for further improvement of the sensor design to achieve optimal detection at the standard quantum limit. We demonstrate AFM operation with surface-tracking feedback in both amplitude-modulation and frequency-modulation modes. ",

        "text": "The past two decades have seen the emergence of a variety of remarkable microscopic and mesoscopic optomechanical devices. Through innovative design and fabrication, new record values of fundamental figures of merit have been reported at a surprisingly rapid rate. The field is now mature for the next challenge – application-ready devices. Optomechanical interaction has been proposed to enable or improve many applications [1], including accelerometers [2], tests of quantum gravity [3-5], force microscopy [6,7], magnetometry [8] and quantum state transfer [9]. In some cases further improvement on fundamental figures of merit is required, while in other cases the difficulty lies in balancing trade-offs to find an optimal design which fulfills the specific requirements of the application. The latter is indeed the case for force sensing in atomic force microscopy (AFM). Force transduction at maximum sensitivity requires detecting the position of a “test mass”, while minimizing the added noise introduced by the detection itself [10,11]. The challenge for high-resolution AFM is designing such a detector for a force transducer hosting a sharp tip and scanning over a surface in ultra-high vacuum and at ultra-low temperature. ",

Using the principles of cavity optomechanics [12], we detect the deflection of the cantilever from its equilibrium position as a shift of the microwave resonance. We briefly summarize the operating principle of the force sensor based on kinetic-inductive electromechanical coupling (KIMEC), whose design and fabrication were already presented in detail in previous publications by our group [13,14]. Here we focus on the deployment of the force sensor, demonstrating force-gradient sensing and scanning over a test surface at $1 0 \\mathrm { m K }$ in a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator (DR). We operate the microscope with surface-tracking feedback using the two most common imaging modes of dynamic AFM: amplitude modulation (AM-AFM) and frequency modulation (FM-AFM). ",

However, force sensors with integrated position detectors, as the one presented in this work, do not require free-space optical alignment with a long optical path length. They can therefore be made light and compact, significantly reducing their susceptibility to external vibrations, the complexity of vibration isolation, and their thermal mass. For this prototype we implement a rather simple vibration isolation which, as we will show, is sufficient to demonstrate imaging features in a $1 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ scan field, but has not been tested to atomic resolution.

We characterize the sensor by measuring the total noise of the undriven mechanical resonance, upconverted to the microwave spectrum. Figure 2(a) shows the data for Probe 1, obtained by converting the measured upper motional sideband to an equivalent displacement PSD $S _ { \\zeta \\zeta } ^ { \\mathrm { t o t } }$ through eq. (5) with $\\Delta = - \\Omega _ { \\mathrm { m } }$ and $n _ { \\mathrm { c } } = 1 . 9 8 \\times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ . Fitting eq. (2) to the measured data we extract the detector (red) and cantilever (orange) contributions to the total noise. Through this fitting procedure we determine an effective temperature of the cantilever $T = 0 . 7 4 { \\mathrm { K } }$ , which is substantially higher than the bath temperature $T _ { \\mathrm { b a t h } } = 1 0 \\mathrm { m K }$ . The discrepancy is most likely due to inertial actuation by noise from the piezo shaker and decoupling of the cantilever eigenmode from the thermal bath. ",

The PID loop controls the $z$ -extension of the scanner to keep oscillation amplitude constant at about $2 0 0 \\mathrm { p m }$ . The blue-detuned cantilever drive ensures that the PI controller retracts the ??-scanner in the event of a sudden drop in the measured signal, thus avoiding crashing the probe into the surface. The image in Figure 4(a) is acquired with a measurement bandwidth of $\\Delta f = 1 . 5 \\mathrm { H z } < \\Gamma$ , corresponding to a scan rate of roughly 67 s/line. The choice of the integral gain is crucial for optimal surface tracking. Too large values of integral gain result in an overly responsive feedback that introduces noise on the topographic image and feedback oscillations. Too low values can lead to instability or loss of surface tracking with abrupt changes in topography. The latter occurred during the scan; in multiple instances the feedback temporarily loses track of the surface immediately after the tip encounters a step. The single scan line on the fast, i.e. $x$ -axis, shown in Figure 4(b)–(c) clearly shows different behavior of trace and retrace scan directions. We achieved faster imaging and improved stability with FM-AFM as shown in Figure 5. FM-AFM requires phase-sensitive detection of tip displacement using a scheme described in detail in earlier publications [13,30]. The cantilever is now driven on resonance at the same $\\simeq 2 0 0 \\mathrm { p m }$ oscillation amplitude while the microwave resonator is driven with two pump tones of equal intensity and symmetrically detuned with $\\Delta = \\pm \\Omega _ { \\mathrm { m } }$ . The lower and upper motional sidebands from the two pumps interfere at $\\omega _ { 0 }$ , resulting in microwave response amplitude which depends on the phase of the mechanical motion [31,32]. The feedback controls the $z$ -extension to maintain a constant microwave response amplitude, or constant mechanical response phase. The tracking of the surface is more consistent using this FM-AFM feedback scheme as shown in Figure 5(b)–(c) by the trace and retrace signals.

This is a significant improvement over much lower frequency piezoelectric transduction methods commonly used for lowtemperature AFM, which can work at the thermal limit down to some $1 0 \\mathrm { K }$ . We estimate that, with reasonable improvements on the current KIMEC sensor design, this detection principle will be capable of operating at the fundamental limit of minimum added noise.

Alternatively, the lower noise of the KIMEC detection principle allows for AFM imaging with increased pixel acquisition rate (measurement bandwidth) without degrading force sensitivity. ",
